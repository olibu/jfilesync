/**
 * Sorts a list of objects using the heap sort algorithm. The class is used to
 * sort a list of file names. ATTENTION: We have to compare the strings of the
 * file names instead of using the compareTo method of the file objects itself.
 * This is necessary because the predefined order differs between the File
 * object und the String object. The new JFSFile object compares the Strings of
 * the file names and implements the Comparable Interface.
